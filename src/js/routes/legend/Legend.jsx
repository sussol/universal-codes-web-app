        <p>In previous iterations of our universal code server we had considered using a
        structured code. However, we have decided it is bad practice to overload a code
        with meaning. Information such as strength, dose form, ATC code, WHO code etc will
        be provided via other fields returned by the API in future versions.</p>
        <p>The two properties of our codes that matter are:</p>
          <ul><li>uniqueness</li>
            <li>immutability- once an item is assigned a code, it ain't ever going to change.</li>
            <li>(and less so) readability - they are short and unambiguous when read by a human,
            which will occasionally be useful. We do, however, expect most "reading" of the codes
            to be done by machines, the two points above are all that matter.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
