    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      We were reluctant to publish a Universal Code server of our own,
      as after all, we’ve read this cartoon: <br />
      <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">https://xkcd.com/927/</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      However, to our (limited) knowledge none of the existing universal codes
      do what we needed them to do. Which is to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code items on their generic name, not their trade name (good-bye GTINs etc...)</li>
      <li>Code items based on their strength and dosage formulation (good-bye https://www.unspsc.org/)</li>
      <li>Not include the pack size (good-bye <a href="http://www.upc-search.org">http://www.upc-search.org</a>) as we want to aggregate data across pack sizes</li>
      <li>Have a freely available API so that applications can obtain codes as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>You can browse universal codes on this site, or use the API at <a href="https://sussol.github.io/universal-drug-codes-server/">https://sussol.github.io/universal-drug-codes-server/</a></p>

    <h2>How much?</h2>
    <p>It’s free.<br />
    Please don’t abuse the service, or we will have to change this policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact?</h2>
    <p>
      Feel free to email <a href="mailto:info@msupply.org.nz">info@msupply.org.nz </a>
      with suggestions or requests for additions or deletions
    </p>

    <h2>Plans for the future</h2>
    <p>
      We intend to expand this service to also return reference pricing,
      Defined daily doses, DDD factors, WHO EML categories etc
    </p>
